Introduction
============

MOVES is a software package developed by the US EPA for estimating pollution
from cars. MOVES is a valuable resource for analysts because it is based 
upon substantial and rigourous research. Some analysts may be required 
to use MOVES because it is mandatory for certain analyses linked to federal
transportation funding. 
Unfortunately, using MOVES is sometimes tedious. In typical usage analysts must construct 
and maintain several
input tables, then configure and launch the MOVES run using a series of menu options,
forms, and mouse clicks. The cost of running MOVES discourages exploratory analysis or 
any type of analysis that requires more than a few runs.  
movespy aims to make using MOVES easier by making it easy to
write programs to automate MOVES runs and retrieve the results.

Currently movespy focuses on project-level on-road analyses. In the future
movespy may also focus on county-level or off-road analyses.


Design
======

The core component of movespy is the :class:`Moves` class. Instances of the :class:`Moves`
class are initialized with activity and options parameters which completely 
specify a MOVES run. Calling the :meth:`run` method of a :class:`Moves` instance executes a 
complete MOVES run, including creating all necessary input files, importing them to 
an input database,
executing the run, and cleaning up temporary files and databases. The :meth:`run` method 
returns the results of the run in a Python list for easy inspection and 
manipulation.
